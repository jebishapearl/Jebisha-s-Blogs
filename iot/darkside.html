    <h1>The Dark Side of Smart Devices: IoT Security Threats You Should Know</h1>
    <p><em>A look at common IoT security risks and how to protect your devices</em></p>
  </header>

    <a href="#" class="back-link">&larr; Back to Home</a>

    <p>Smart bulbs, fitness trackers, voice assistants, baby monitors — all part of the Internet of Things (IoT) family. They make life easier, but there’s a catch: many of these devices come with security risks that most people don’t even think about.</p>

    <h2>What Makes IoT Devices Vulnerable?</h2>
    <p>Most IoT devices are designed to be small, cheap, and simple. That’s great for keeping costs low and battery life long — but not so great for security. Here’s why:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No strong passwords:</strong> Many devices come with default passwords like “admin” or “1234” — and users often don’t change them.</li>
      <li><strong>Weak or no encryption:</strong> Data can be sent over Wi-Fi in plain text, which means anyone nearby can snoop in.</li>
      <li><strong>Rare updates:</strong> Unlike your phone or laptop, smart plugs or baby cams might never get security updates — even when a flaw is found.</li>
      <li><strong>Always online:</strong> These devices are often connected to your home network 24/7, making them easy targets if left unsecured.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Real-World Example: The Baby Monitor Hack</h2>
    <p>In several reported cases, strangers have spoken to babies through hacked baby monitors. How? The cameras weren’t protected with strong passwords or updates. Hackers found them, took control, and used them to spy or talk — a chilling reminder that smart doesn’t always mean safe.</p>

    <h2>What Could Go Wrong?</h2>
    <p>It’s not just about creepy stories. Here’s what can happen when IoT security fails:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Privacy leaks:</strong> Devices like smart speakers might be listening more than you expect.</li>
      <li><strong>Home network attacks:</strong> If one device is hacked, it can become a backdoor to everything else on your Wi-Fi.</li>
      <li><strong>Botnets:</strong> Hackers can hijack thousands of devices and use them to attack websites — your smart fridge could become part of a global cyberattack.</li>
      <li><strong>Data theft:</strong> Smart health devices can expose personal medical information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Stay Safe: Simple Tips</h2>
    <p>Good news: You don’t need to be a tech expert to secure your devices. Here are practical steps you can take right now:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Change default passwords:</strong> Always create a strong, unique password for every device.</li>
      <li><strong>Update firmware:</strong> If the device has an app, check for updates often.</li>
      <li><strong>Use guest Wi-Fi:</strong> Connect your smart devices to a separate Wi-Fi network from your phone and computer.</li>
      <li><strong>Turn off what you don’t use:</strong> Don’t leave unused features or devices running all day.</li>
      <li><strong>Buy from trusted brands:</strong> Big names are more likely to take security seriously.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Big Picture</h2>
    <p>IoT devices are like digital doors into your home. If those doors are left wide open, it’s not hard for someone to walk in. But with a few simple habits and some awareness, you can enjoy the convenience of smart tech without inviting in unwanted guests.</p>
